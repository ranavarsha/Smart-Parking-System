# Smart-Parking-System
Smart Parking and Space Detector project leverages IoT technology using the ESP32 microcontroller, infrared sensors, and Wi-Fi to manage parking spaces efficiently. It automatically detects vehicle presence in parking slots using IR sensors and displays the real-time availability status using LEDs—green for vacant and red for occupied. The ESP32 continuously reads sensor data and sends it to a cloud server, allowing users to view real-time updates through a mobile or web interface. This system reduces traffic congestion, saves drivers’ time, and supports smart city initiatives by integrating predictive analytics and future scalability with payment systems and AI. The project demonstrates a practical and scalable approach to modern urban parking challenges.
